# Namespace: A Decentralized Naming and Identity System on the Blockchain

**Namespace** is a decentralized naming and identity system that operates on decentralized networks. On the blockchain, naming and identity are crucial as each digital asset needs to have a unique identifier that distinguishes it from others. However, traditional naming systems have limitations in terms of decentralization, community identity, and security. On the Ethereum network, .eth is an example of a naming system but it is limited to identifying users on that specific network. However, communities on Ethereum are flourishing, and they need their own unique identities to represent their brand or organization. With Namespace, users can create their own custom namespaces, such as .bayc or .coolcats or .azuki, to represent their community on the blockchain. This is where Namespace comes in - to resolve the problem of naming and identity by making use of decentralized networks. Both IPFS and blockchain technology offer unique benefits for decentralization. They provide a distributed, resilient network for storing and sharing data, while eliminating the need for a central authority. With Namespace, users can take advantage of these technologies and easily access and share content across these decentralized networks while maintaining their own distinct digital identity. Namespace enables users to create unique names and spaces that serve as identifiers for their digital assets and online presence. With Namespace, users can easily locate and identify content stored in decentralized networks (IPFS and Blockchain), share their profiles and links, and showcase their community memberships.
